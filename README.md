# Company project

This project contains a class, a notebook and an excel template. This is a class is used to model the financials of a publicly traded company. The notebook provides a convinient way to use the class and has various examples which may be modified as a starting point. The excel spreasheet is a template file which is used for creating a report for documentation and display purposes.   

## Company Class

The python code 'company.py' contains a which allows modelling a company financially. With financial forecasts in various forms or levels of precision, one can input company financial foecasts. These can then form the basis for the calculation of free-cash flows (FCFE or FCFF, collectively referred to here FCF's). Once the FCF's have been calculated using the appropriate method, they can then be used for various purposes, specifically they can pay down debt, buyback shares, or even make an acquisition. 

You may refer to the docstring in the class for more details on its use or the notebook for examples on its us

## Valuation notebook

The jupyter notebook 'Valuation notebook.ipynb' is a convenient way of using the company class. It contains various examples which can be modified for your own use. The examples make it fairly intuitive (I think), and can be self-interpreted so that you can use the class with little or no explanation.

## Company template 

The company template is a file which is called with the cmp.display_fin() method which is used to create a spreadsheet report
